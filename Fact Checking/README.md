# Assignment 2

In order to keep things cleaner as possible, we've split everything into two notebooks:
* [specifications.ipynb](specifications.ipynb) the notebook provided by Galassi, Ruggeri and Torroni, containing all the specifications for this project
* [Assignment_2.ipynb](fact_checking.ipynb) the notebook containing the actual solution code
